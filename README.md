#react-hooks playground
Using
state
effect
context
custom (fetch)

I originally wrote this to understand the context hook api. Then I added loads of junk to get more Hooks practice.

The dog pics use the useFetch custom hook, and trigger off of the same piece of state (theme) that changes background, though in a different way.
